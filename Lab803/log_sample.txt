The plane defined by (x-a)*n =0 is:
  a = (500, 300, 200)
  n = (1,2,3)
The eye e is:
  e = (800, 50, 123)

Vertices I used to create he 2d coordinate system and their projections are:
v1 = (100.0,100.0,100.0)
v2 = (...,...,...)
v3 = (...,...,...)

pv1 = (...,...,...)
pv2 = (...,...,...)
pv3 = (...,...,...)

The 2 vectors a and b that are in plane are:
a = pv1-pv2 = (....,...,...)
b = pv3-pv1 = (...,...,...) 

The w1 and w2 obtained from a and b (these now are perpendicular and of magnitude 1) are:
w1 = (...,...,...)
w2 = (...,...,...)

The center of the cube in first frame and its projection are:
center = (...,...,...)
p0 = (...,...,...)

The coordinates in the 2d plane x = p0 + u*w1 + v*w2 are:
(where p0 is the origin, preferraby the projection of the center of the cube in first frame, w1 and w2 are 2 perpendicular vertices in the plane)
  p0 = (..,..,..)
  w1 = (..,..,..)
  w2 = (..,..,..)

The frame1 in 3d has the following edges:
(should be 12 edges, 12 pairs of 3d coordinates (x,y,z))
  (100.00,100.000,100.0001), (100,-100,100)
  (100,100,100), (100,100,-100)
  (100,100,100), (-100,100,100)
