Name of file should be l031.cpp (lowercase L followed by the digits 0,3,1) in which

Your main should call only part0() and part1() methods

 

In part0() method you should:

  a) ask the user if they want to generate the points

  b) if the answer is yes then generate 60 random points

  c)  then save the points in the file points.txt in the same format as the points.txt file attached

 

In part1() method you should:

  a) read the points that are in the points.txt file (file either generated by part0 or the file is already there) and save them in a list

  b) solve the closest-pair problem in the unit square using the"brute force"approach discussed in class. (use at least one iterator over the list)

  c) create points.ppm file in which you draw a bold black circle of radius 3 for every point you generated and you draw a bold red circle of radius 3 for the 2 closest points you found (you may make the circles bold by drawig a circle of radius 2 and a circle of radius 3) 

  d) display on the screen the 2 closest points and the distance between them (so the minimum distance)

  e) Complete the document Project 3 Part 1.docx attached

Guidelines:

In this project you must store the points you generated in a list (not an array) and you must use at least one iterator in your application to traverse the list you just created. All points stored in the file points.txt follow the sample attached, in which each line will have the coordinate of one point (Ex:points.txt )

Use a bold circle of radius 3 to signal a point in the ppm (since points are not really visible). Use white background for the ppm.
