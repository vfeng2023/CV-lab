Using convert utility on Linux workstations item options
You can use the convert utility to change a .ppm (P3) file to , say, .jpg format like this:

$>convert infile.ppm outfile.jpg

However, if you try to convert a .jpg file to .ppm file by typing

$>convert infile.jpg outfile.ppm

you will get a P6-formatted .ppm file, which you won't be able to read with a text-editor (other than the first line).

In order to convert a .jpg file to .ppm (P3) format (which can be inspected with a text editor), type

$>convert -compress none infile.jpg outfile.ppm
