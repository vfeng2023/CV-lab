# CV-lab
Computer vision labs completed for Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology's Computer Vision I & II class. Labs are written in C++, and use OpenCV. The file readme.txt contains an outline of the project. The .docx file titled in the format Project_#_Part_# contain sample outputs for each run.
# Lab 1
Designed graphics class, implemented calculations for Euler's line, and found circumscribed and inscribed circle for a randomly generated triangle.

# Lab 2
Find the smallest square that can be created from four points where each side of the square passes through one of the four points

# Lab 3
Given a set randomly generated points in the 2D plane, find the closest two points

# Lab 4
Find the convex hull enclosing a set of randomly generated points

# Lab 5
Implement the Canny Edge Detection algorithm using standard C++ libraries

# Lab 6
Identify coins using implementations of Hough Circle Transform and Canny Edge Detection written with standard C++ libraries

# Lab 7
Design a pipeline to identify coins in an image using OpenCV

# Lab 8
Produce a video of a rotating platonic solid viewed from an arbitary eye and viewing plane
