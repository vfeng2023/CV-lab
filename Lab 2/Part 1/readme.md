Part 1:
Create a method called part1 in which:
Generate 3 random points (optional: check that they are not collinear), then generate a 4th random point such that no point among the 4 points lies inside the triangle formed by the other 3 points in the square unit ([0,1]x[0,1]). If the last point generated fails the condition, you discard it then you keep generating a new random 4th point until the condition is true.
Once you have 4 such points save the 4 points in a file called points.txt following the format of the file:points.txt

(notice the precision, maybe look up how to use setprecision when you cout, or how to use fprintf)

When you finish submit the file l021.cpp file (lowercase L followed by th digits 021) and also complete and submit the following document, with the examples of points.txt obtained in 2 random runs: Project 2 Part 1 document.docx
